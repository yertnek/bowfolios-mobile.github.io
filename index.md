# Overview
BowFolios Mobile is an mobile app of the original BowFolios web application. Users have the ability to create a profile, add interests, and profiles. It provides the ability to view and modify profiles, projects, and interests. It is a quick way to find other UH Manoa students with the same interests and view their previous and current projects. 

For Milestone 1, we created the user interface for the login, create account, profiles, interests, projects, drawer navigation, and set up firebase for backend data storage and user authentication. Users can currently login, but not logout.

For Milestone 2, we plan to implement backend features to the profiles, interests, projects page, and implement a logout feature. We also want to route the widgets in the drawer navigation.

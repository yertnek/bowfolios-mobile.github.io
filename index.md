# Overview
Bowfolios Mobile is an mobile app of the original Bowfolios web application. Users have the ability to create a profile, add interests, and profiles. It provides the ability to view and modify profiles, projects, and interests. It is a quick way to find other UH Manoa students with the same interests and view their previous and current projects. 

For Milestone 1, we created the user interface for the login, create account, profiles, interests, projects, and set up firebase for backend data storage and user authentication.
